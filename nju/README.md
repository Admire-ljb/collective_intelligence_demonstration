Place the `settings.json` at `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\AirSim\`.
By convention, the UAVs are named `f'uav_{i}'`. 
More UAVs can be added by modifying this file.
We implement the standard interface of a MARL environment in `airsim_eval.py`.

Please download the test environment (exe, for windows) from `https://box.nju.edu.cn/f/c6cd3e50b7aa414fb13f/?dl=1`.
Before starting the python script, run the downloaded exe first.



TBD @ wjf

1. construct the observation for each UAV
2. check the action to instruction mapping
